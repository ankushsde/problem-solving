// This is how I would explain it:

// You enter a URL into a web browser
// The browser looks up the IP address for the domain name via DNS
// The browser sends a HTTP request to the server
// The server sends back a HTTP response
// The browser begins rendering the HTML
// The browser sends requests for additional objects embedded in HTML (images, css, JavaScript) and repeats steps 3-5.
// Once the page is loaded, the browser sends further async requests as needed.
// That’s really it. Here’s a description in words for this site.

// When you type “https://wsvincent.com” into your browser the first thing that happens is a Domain Name Server (DNS) matches 
// “wsvincent.com” to an IP address. Then the browser sends an HTTP request to the server and the server sends back an HTTP response. 
// The browser begins rendering the HTML on the page while also requesting any additional resources such as CSS, JavaScript, images, etc. 
// Each subsequent request completes a request/response cycle and is rendered in turn by the browser. Then once the page is loaded some sites 
// (though not mine) will make further asynchronous requests.
